## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hiralchudasam/cvbroadcaster.git
    cd cvbroadcaster
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Model Weights:**

    - Ensure `yolov8m-seg.pt` is present in the project root.  
    - If not, download the YOLOv8 segmentation weights from [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and place them in the root directory.

## Usage

Start the application with:

- Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in your configuration).  
- Start streaming and segmentation!
